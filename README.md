# SoftwareInstallationScript
This Project allows you to run Chocolatey installations out of a CSV file. Since I am reinstalling my Windows now and then, I have to reinstall all applications. Since I am pretty lazy, I tried to automate this. 

# How to use
At first, you have to choose, which Software you want the script to install. Available Software can be found here: https://community.chocolatey.org/packages.
After you choose e.g. VLC Media Player, you have to copy the package name (found underneath the image next to "choco install". In this case, "choco install vlc")
Now you just have to copy "vlc" at the end of the csv. It is up to you, if you don't want any other software inside the CSV, just go ahead and delete everything :).
When the CSV is done, just run the "Run.bat" AS ADMINISTRATOR and wait for it to finish.
